           lines easier to read anyway
- Changed: FileReadLine() and FileWriteLine() modified so that they optionally accept a filename
           instead of a filehandle for "quick 'n' dirty" file access - I'm sure this will be

           RunAsSet, Shutdown, RegWrite, RegDelete, WinWait, WinWaitActive, WinWaitClose, WinWaitNotActive,
           ProcessWait, ProcessWaitClose.  If you were using the return values of one of
           these functions then please check your scripts.
